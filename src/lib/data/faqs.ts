    question:
      "Does having a family history of breast cancer increase one's risk?",
    answer: `Although those who have a family history of the disease are at higher risk, the majority of breast cancer victims do not. According to statistics, only 5â€“10% of people who are diagnosed with breast cancer have a family history of it.

    However, when there is a family history of breast cancer, genetic testing may be recommended to determine if you and your family have a breast cancer gene mutation.

    question: "Are oral contraceptives associated with breast cancer?",
    answer: `
    Women who have used birth control pills for more than five years are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer. The risk is minimal, though, because modern birth control pills contain very little hormone. However, if a young woman has a strong family history of breast cancer, her gynecologist might advise stopping the pill for a year at the 5-year mark and starting it up again for another 5 years. Although this standard of treatment does not have substantial backing from evidence-based research, it has nonetheless become a more widespread practice.
